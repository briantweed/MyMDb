Keanu\'s father was born in Hawaii, of British, Portuguese, Native Hawaiian, and Chinese ancestry.

His first popular success was the role of totally rad dude "Ted Logan" in {{Bill & Ted\'s Excellent Adventure (1989)}}. The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves\'s real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. In 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release of {{Speed (1994)}}. Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, like Feeling Minnesota (1996) and The Last Time I Committed Suicide (1997), and big films like A Walk in the Clouds (1995) and The Devil\'s Advocate (1997).

After all this, Reeves did the unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski siblings\' cyberadventure, {{The Matrix (1999)}}.',

He attended theater schools throughout his life, and eventually managed to find work on stage in New York as a member of the Signature players, who produced the works of playwright and director Edward Albee. Around the time when he was appearing in Albee\'s Fragments, in Hollywood, they were looking for a young actor to star opposite Richard Gere in a new courtroom thriller, {{Primal Fear (1996)}}.  Before the film was even released, his test screenings for the part were causing a Hollywood sensation, and he was soon offered roles in Woody Allen\'s Everyone Says I Love You (1996) and The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996).

Edward won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in {{Primal Fear (1996). In 1998, Norton gained 30 pounds of muscle and transformed his look into that of a monstrous skinhead for his role as a violent white supremacist in {{American History X (1998)}}.

While working at a comedy club in L.A., he was "discovered" by Dennis Miller, who recommended him to Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels and told him that Sandler had a big talent. This led to his being cast in the show in 1990, which he also wrote for in addition to performing.

However, it was when he married Lori Anne Allison (Lori A. Depp) that he took up the job of being a ballpoint-pen salesman to support himself and his wife. A visit to Los Angeles, California, with his wife, however, happened to be a blessing in disguise, when he met up with actor Nicolas Cage, who advised him to turn to acting, which culminated in Depp\'s film debut in the low-budget horror film, {{A Nightmare on Elm Street}}, where he played a teenager who falls prey to dream-stalking demon Freddy Krueger.

Depp has played many characters in his career, including another fact-based one, Insp. Fred Abberline in From Hell. He stole the show from screen greats such as Antonio Banderas in the finale to Robert Rodriguez\'s "mariachi" trilogy, {{Once Upon a Time in Mexico}}. In that same year he starred in the marvelous family blockbuster {{Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl}}, playing a character that only the likes of Depp could pull off: the charming, conniving and roguish Capt.

Bonham Carter was nominated for a Golden Globe for the fifth time for her role in partner Tim Burton\'s film adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), for which Burton and co-star Johnny Depp were also nominated. For the role, she was awarded Best Actress at the Evening Standard British Film Awards 2008.

She gained widespread recognition for her roles in The Princess Diaries (2001) and its 2004 sequel as a young girl who discovers she is a member of royalty, opposite Julie Andrews and Heather Matarazzo.

She also had a notable role in Nicholas Nickleby (2002) opposite Charlie Hunnam and Jamie Bell, and a starring role in Ella Enchanted (2004). A former top-ranking soprano in New York, Hathaway was reportedly a front-runner for the role of "Christine" in the 2004 The Phantom of the Opera (2004). However, due to scheduling conflicts with The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), she couldn\'t take the role, which was later given to newcomer Emmy Rossum.

Hathaway soon started to move away from family-friendly films. Following The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), she appeared topless in the films Havoc (2005) opposite Josh Peck and Brokeback Mountain (2005) opposite Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.',

Spielberg has countless big-grossing, critically acclaimed credits to his name, as producer, director and writer.

Spielberg\'s first major directorial effort was The Sugarland Express (1974), with Goldie Hawn, a film that marked him as a rising star. It was his next effort, however, that made him an international superstar among directors: {{Jaws (1975)}}. He hit gold yet one more time with {{Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)}}, with Harrison Ford taking the part of Indiana Jones. Spielberg produced and directed two films in 1982. The first was {{Poltergeist (1982)}}, but the highest-grossing movie of all time up to that point was the alien story E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982).',

As the story goes, in junior high school it was compulsory to take one of two electives, either cooking or drama. As Heath could not see himself in a cooking class he tried his hand at drama. Heath was talented, however the rest of the class did not acknowledge his talent. When he was seventeen he and a friend decided to pack up, leave school, take a car and rough it to Sydney. Heath believed Sydney to be the place where dreams were made or, at least, where actors could possibly get their big break. Upon arriving in Sydney with a purported sixty-nine cents to his name, Heath tried everything to get a break.

Heath finally had deserved success with his role in Brokeback Mountain (2005), for which he was nominated for an Oscar and a B.A.F.T.A. Ledger was found dead on January 22, 2008 in his apartment in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo, with a bottle of prescription sleeping pills near-by. It was concluded weeks later that he died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs that included pain-killers, sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. After his death he received more than thirty posthumous awards for his portrayal as the psychopathic clown prince of crime in The Dark Knight (2008) (including the Oscar, S.A.G., B.A.F.T.A., and Golden Globe)',

She is the only child of Avner Hershlag, an Israeli-born doctor, and Shelley Stevens, an American-born artist (from Cincinnati, Ohio), who also acts as Natalie\'s agent. She left Israel for Washington, D.C., when she was still very young. After a few more moves, her family finally settled in New York, where she still lives to this day. 

She graduated with honors, and her academic achievements allowed her to attend Harvard University. She was discovered by an agent in a pizza parlor at the age of 11. She was pushed towards a career in modeling but she decided that she would rather pursue a career in acting. She was featured in many live performances, but she made her powerful film debut in the movie Léon.

Following this role Natalie won roles in such films as Heat, Beautiful Girls, and Mars Attacks!. She received an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Black Swan.',

Meat Loaf stayed in the dark through the eighties doing 4 records which never got any airplay or chart position in the US. Meat Loaf appeared in films Out of Bounds (1986) as a Pilot, and The Squeeze (1987) with Michael Keaton. But after getting back together with Steinman, they delivered a powerful sequel &quot;Bat Out Of Hell II&quot; which went to #1 in the US and UK. Bat II has now sold an excess of 20,000,000 copies. His TV credits include the Soldier being held prisoner in Vietnam in Lightning Force (1991), a mad Doctor who invents a serum to keep zombies from deteriorating in Monsters (1988) and a slick Landlord of a restaurant who ends up on the menu in HBO series Tales from the Crypt (1989).

His parents were Anna (Boselli), who had emigrated from Carpi (MO), Italy, and Camillo Borgnino, who had emigrated from Ottiglio (AL), Italy. As an only child, Ernest enjoyed most sports, especially boxing, but took no real interest in acting. At age 18, after graduating from high school in New Haven, and undecided about his future career, he joined the United States Navy, where he stayed for ten years until leaving in 1945. After a few factory jobs, his mother suggested that his forceful personality could make him suitable for a career in acting, and Borgnine promptly enrolled at the Randall School of Drama in Hartford. After completing the course, he joined Robert Porterfield&#039;s famous Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, staying there for four years, undertaking odd jobs and playing every type of role imaginable. His big break came in 1949, when he made his acting debut on Broadway playing a male nurse in &quot;Harvey&quot;. In 1951, Borgnine moved to Los Angeles to pursue a movie career, and made his film debut as Bill Street in The Whistle at Eaton Falls (1951). His career took off in 1953 when he was cast in the role of Sergeant &quot;Fatso&quot; Judson in From Here to Eternity (1953). This memorable performance led to numerous supporting roles as &quot;heavies&quot; in a steady string of dramas and westerns. He played against type in 1955 by securing the lead role of Marty P...',

Even the Van Helsing-like psychiatrist Sam Loomis in the Halloween (1978) franchise seems only marginally more balanced than his prey. An actor of great intensity, Pleasence excelled on stage as Shakespearean villains. He was an unrelenting prosecutor in Jean Anouilh&#039;s &quot;Poor Bitos&quot; and made his theatrical reputation in the title role of the seedy, scheming tramp in Harold Pinter&#039;s &quot;The Caretaker&quot; (1960). On screen, he gave a perfectly plausible interpretation of the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, in The Eagle Has Landed (1976). He was a convincingly devious Thomas Cromwell in Henry VIII and His Six Wives (1972), disturbing in his portrayal of the crazed, bloodthirsty preacher Quint in Will Penny (1967); and as sexually depraved, alcohol-sodden &#039;Doc&#039; Tydon in the brilliant Aussie outback drama Wake in Fright (1971). And, of course, he was Ernst Stavro Blofeld in You Only Live Twice (1967).

His mother died when he was young, and his father moved the family to a farm in Pennsylvania. A basketball player with an interest in acting, he decided to follow the family way and study business at the University of California in San Diego. A class in acting resulted in his being bitten by the acting bug, and he subsequently dropped out and began studying with legendary acting teacher Stella Adler in Los Angeles and at the Circle in the Square Acting School in New York City. Telling his parents that he was taking courses in business, Del Toro hid his new studies from his family for a little while. During the late 1980s he made a few TV appearances, most notably in an episode of Miami Vice (1984) and in the NBC miniseries Drug Wars: The Camarena Story (1990). Del Toro&#039;s big-screen career got off to a slower start, however--his first role was Duke the Dog-Faced Boy in Big Top Pee-wee (1988).

Jena is often described as having a maturity beyond her years and, in her career thus far, she has often tackled roles that are difficult and are not standard fare for actors her age. Malone&#039;s first claim to fame was in performing the title role in Bastard Out of Carolina (1996) for which she won the Young Artist Award, and which she filmed when she was merely ten years old. This movie dealt with issues of child abuse, violence and sex. Jena has said in later interviews that this movie and her participation in it continue to influence her life substantially. Showing self-assurance and a clear vision of personal goals from an early age, Jena, at age 14, was encouraged to try out for Air Force One (1997), a movie that was virtually guaranteed to be a success since box-office king Harrison Ford was cast in the lead, but Jena said she&#039;d prefer to seek other roles that were of more interest to her.

Born and raised in Washington DC, Wright graduated from the prestigious Amherst college in 1987. Although he studied Political Science while at Amherst, Wright left the school with something that would prove to be more valuable: a love for acting. Shortly after graduating he won an acting scholarship to NYU, but dropped out after only two months to pursue acting full time. With roles in 1990&#039;s Presumed Innocent, and the Broadway production of Angels in America, (in which he won a well deserved Tony award), within a relatively short time Wright was able to show off his exceptional talent and ability on both stage and screen alike. His first major on-screen performance came in 1996 in the Julian Schnabel directed film Basquiat. Wright&#039;s harrowing performance as the late painter Jean Michele Basquiat was critically acclaimed for its haunting accuracy and raw emotion. With a Tony, a Golden Globe, and an AFI award under his belt, the intensity of Wright&#039;s skill has been proven over and over again. Hopefully the near future will bring an influx of more varied lead roles for black actors so that Wright can continue to astonish his colleagues, critics and fans alike with the intensity of his skill.',

They were usually short, but they already had the trademark that would make Jackson famous: impressive special effects, made at a very low cost. For example, for his film &quot;World War Two&quot; which he made as a teenager, he used to simulate a firing gun by punching little holes into the celluloid, so that, once projected, the gun gave the impression of displaying a small fire. Jackson&#039;s first step towards more serious film-making came with an entry in a local contest to stimulate amateur and children&#039;s films. For this film, he used stop-motion animation to create a monster that ruins a city in the style of Ray Harryhausen. Unfortunately, he didn&#039;t win. At twenty-two, he embarked on a movie-making adventure that would change his life. This film, Bad Taste (1987), was begun as any other Jackson film, in an amateur style, at a low budget and using friends and local people to star in his film.

The second, The Sum of Us (1994), helped put him on the American map, so to speak. Sharon Stone heard of him from Romper Stomper (1992) and wanted him for her film, Mort ou vif (1995). But filming on The Sum of Us (1994) had already begun. Sharon is reported to have held up shooting until she had her gunslinger-Crowe, for her film.

Audiences first were taken in by his sexually arresting portrayal of a sociopathic killer in the gripping prison drama Oz (1997) on cable TV. Although his small screen roots were in 90s situation comedy, the network powers-that-be wisely discovered his power and allure as a dramatic star and quickly handed him his own prime-time crime series, Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (1999), as a not-quite-by-the-book crime detective. This one-two punch of &quot;Oz&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot; put Meloni, who seems to grow sexier with age, on the map and well on top, where he remains today.

Of Italian and French-Canadian parentage, he attended St. Stephen&#039;s School and played quarterback for his high school team. Developing an interest in acting rather early in life, he attended the University of Colorado at Boulder following high school graduation.

Josh was initially against the lifestyle of the entertainment business, in light of his parents&#039; divorce, and both of them being actors. However during junior year in high school he took an acting class to see what it was like and played Stanley in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; and became hooked. His first major screen role was as the older brother in the film The Goonies (1985), based on a story by Steven Spielberg. He then immediately moved on to work on television, taking roles in such series as Private Eye (1987) and The Young Riders (1989). &quot;Private Eye&quot; was a chance for Brolin to play a detective. &quot;The Young Riders&quot; was set just before the Civil War, and was co-directed by Brolin&#039;s father, James Brolin. After The Young Riders (1989), Brolin moved back to the big screen, with mediocre success. He played a supporting role in The Road Killers (1994), but the film was not a hit. He followed up with the crime film Gang in Blue (1996), the romantic film Bed of Roses (1996), the thriller film Nightwatch (1997), and appeared with his father in My Brother&#039;s War (1...',

A large, somewhat looming fellow, his sly-eyed look and leering gaze, matched with a bright set of pearly teeth and stark pattern baldness, made him a natural for broad, warped comedy. The folks at Three&#039;s Company (1977) brought Jeffrey back time and time again, standing toe-to-toe with John Ritter and stealing many of their scenes with his noticeably bizarre gents.

At 16, Rogan came in second place in the 1998 Vancouver Amateur Comedy Contest. Soon after that he landed his first role in Judd Apatow&#039;s short-lived but well regarded TV series Freaks and Geeks (1999), taking on the role of Ken Miller. Though the show only lasted one season, it was the launching pad for many careers, including Rogen, Apatow, James Franco, and Jason Segel. This early work sharpened Rogen&#039;s keen improvisational skills, which he&#039;s used on many projects since. Following Freaks and Geeks (1999), he participated in a few unsuccessful television projects, and then joined the American television version of Da Ali G Show (2003) as a writer during its second and last season, along with his childhood friend and writing partner Evan Goldberg.

His father was an Italian immigrant, and his mother&#039;s heritage is half French (from Brittany) and half German.

He got a crucial career break alongside fellow young actor Henry Winkler, sharing lead billing in the effectively written teen gang film The Lords of Flatbush (1974). Further film and television roles followed, most of them in uninspiring productions except for the opportunity to play a megalomaniac, bloodthirsty race driver named &quot;Machine Gun Joe Viterbo&quot; in the Roger Corman-produced Death Race 2000 (1975).

Raised in a deeply religious family, Perry&#039;s first experience of performing was singing in church. A passion for music grew and at the age of 15, Perry began visiting Nashville, gaining experience of song writing and recording demos. She signed to a Christian record label, Red Hill, and recorded an album, under her birth name of Katy Hudson. The album was not a success. At age 17 she moved to Los Angeles and collaborated with producer Glen Ballard, but was not able to secure a lasting record deal. Perry did sign to Columbia Records in 2004, but again this did not prove a success, and she was dropped. An executive at Columbia recommended Perry to the chairman of Virgin Records, Jason Flom, which resulted in her signing for Capitol Music Group. She recorded her second album, &quot;One of the Boys&quot; and in the Spring of 2008 released the lead single, the controversial &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot;. The song proved a smash, hitting the number one slot in several countries. Other hit singles followed and the album was a commercial success. Perry was now established as a pop superstar and cemented her position with the release of her next album &quot;Teenage Dreams&quot;, which spawned more huge hits...',

Between 1991-93, Ryan appeared in Fifteen (1990), a Nickleodeon series taped in Florida with many other Canadian actors. After the series ended, he returned to Vancouver where he played in a series of forgettable television movies. He did small roles in Glenn Close&#039;s Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story (1995) and CBS&#039;s update of In Cold Blood (1996). However, his run of luck had led him to decide to quit acting. One night, he ran into fellow Vancouver actor and native Chris William Martin. Martin found Ryan rather despondent and told him to pack everything: they were going to head to Los Angeles, California. The two stayed in a cheap Los Angeles motel. On the first night of their stay, Reynolds&#039; jeep was rolled downhill and stripped. For the next four months, Ryan drove it without doors. In 1997, he landed the role of Berg in Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place (1998). Initially, the show was reviled by critics and seemed desperate for any type of ratings success. However, it was renewed for a second season but with a provision for a makeover by former Roseanne (1988) writer Kevin Abbott. The show became a minor success and has led to additional film roles for Ryan, most notably in the last-ever MGM film, a remake of The Amityville Hor...',

Along with his friends, which included Rob Lowe and Sean Penn, he produced and starred in several amateur Super-8 films. On the Vikings baseball team, he was a star shortstop and pitcher.

She moved to California and worked with improv groups, including Spontaneous Combustion, and developed her skills as a stand-up comedienne.

Two pictures later, she was again nominated for Best Supporting Actress, this time for The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945).

Although active in television since the early 1950s, she obtained her greatest fame in the 1980s by starring in the light mystery program Murder, She Wrote (1984).

David discovered a love of drama in high school and, upon his graduation in 1977, he received the Yaddo Medal which is to honor academic achievement and personal character. However, his love of music was still strong so he decided to study classical piano at Yale University. Unfortunately, he soon grew bored with music history lessons and found that he wasn&#039;t dedicated enough to practice the required amount of hours to become a successful concert pianist. Instead, he returned to his love of drama and graduated in 1981 with a double major in English and Theatre Arts. He then moved to New York where he worked several menial jobs (including selling ties at Bloomingdales and working as a security guard) while acting in the theater during the late 80s and early 90s.

He is of Irish, as well as English, Scottish, and German, descent. Michael studied speech for two years at Kent State, before dropping out and moving to Pittsburgh. An unsuccessful attempt at stand-up comedy led Keaton to working as a TV cameraman in a cable station, and he came to realize he wanted to work in front of the cameras. Keaton first appeared on TV in several episodes of Mister Rogers&#039; Neighborhood (1968). He left Pittsburgh and moved to Los Angeles to begin auditioning for TV. He began cropping up in popular TV shows including Maude (1972) and The Mary Tyler Moore Hour (1979). Around this time, Keaton decided to use an alternative surname to remove confusion with better-known actor Michael Douglas. After reading an article on actress Diane Keaton, he decided that Michael Keaton sounded good. His next break was scoring a co-starring role alongside James Belushi in the short-lived comedy series Working Stiffs (1979), which showcased his comedic talent and led to his co-starring role in Night Shift (1982).

Jason Michael Lee was born and raised in Orange County, California, to Carol Lynn (Weaver) and Gregory E. Lee, a car dealership manager. Jason took up skateboarding at age 13. By 18, he was on the professional skateboarding circuit, where he wowed legions of young fans and popularized a move called the &quot;360 flip&quot;. Inspired to tap into the commercial aspect of the sport, Lee and a friend started the twin companies &quot;Stereo Skateboards&quot; and &quot;Stereo Sounds Clothing&quot;. After moving to Los Angeles during his early twenties, however, he began developing an interest in acting. &quot;I met friends that were actors and thought maybe I should try it out&quot;, says Lee, who appeared in commercials and music videos. &quot;After watching Steve Buscemi as the bellboy in Barton Fink (1991), I knew I wanted to be in movies&quot;, he says. In the early 1990s, Lee took his skateboarding tricks in front of the camera, appearing in several music videos - including one for the Sonic Youth song &quot;100%&quot;, directed by Spike Jonze. Lee got his first taste of straight acting the next year, when he turned up alongside Jonze as a teenage drug cu...',

During the early 80s, she played everything, from a knife-threatening waitress to a disco queen, as she waited for her big break. That big break came in the form of the hugely successful comedy film, Down and Out in Beverly Hills (1986), co-starring Bette Midler, Richard Dreyfuss and Nick Nolte, in which she stole many scenes as the sultry, politically-minded maid, &quot;Carmen&quot;, who lusts for Nolte. This propelled her to move to Los Angeles, where she continued to spice up both the big and small screen, including the part of Ritchie Valens&#039; stepsister-in-law, in the well-received biopic, La Bamba (1987).

Peggy later memorialized this in the calypso number &quot;One Beating a Day&quot;, one of 22 songs she co-wrote for the autobiographical musical &quot;Peg&quot;, in which she made her Broadway debut in 1983 at the age of 62. As a youngster Peggy worked as a milkmaid, later turning to singing for money in her teens. While singing on a local radio station in Fargo, the program director there suggested she change her name to Peggy Lee. Peggy&#039;s big break came when Benny Goodman hired her to sing with his band after hearing her perform. Peggy shot to stardom when she and Goodman cut the hit record &quot;Why Don&#039;t You Do Right?&quot; and went out on her own to record such classics as &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;Lover&quot;, &quot;Golden Earrings&quot;, &quot;Big Spender&quot; and &quot;Is That All There Is?&quot; - the latter winning her a Grammy Award in 1969.

At Cambridge, he took part in a series of comedy revues and shortly after completing his medical studies at St. Bartholomew&#039;s Hospital, Graham realized what he wanted to do with his life. He wanted to perform comedy. In 1969, Graham along with University friends John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Jones and American Terry Gilliam formed the own comedy group called Monty Python.

He received some acting training at the workshop of Tamara Daykarhanova, but later set aside the dream of becoming a performer and segued into directing summer theater. In the mid- to late 1940s, Post made a name for himself in the theater and then moved into the adventurous arena of early television. He has since directed numerous segments of TV\'s top series (Gunsmoke (1955), Perry Mason (1957), The Twilight Zone (1959), "Columbo," many more) and feature films ranging from Clint Eastwood\'s Hang \'Em High (1968) and Magnum Force (1973) to Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970). Returning to his theater roots, Post recently directed the 2001-02 Festival of the Arts at Bel-Air\'s University of Judaism.',

It proved to be very popular and inspired Jim to continue using puppets for his work. He made many commercials, developing the signature humor that Henson Productions is known for. A key reason for the success of his puppets is that Jim realized he didn\'t need to hide puppeteers behind a structure when they were in front of a camera. All he had to do was instruct the camera operators to focus on the puppets and keep the puppeteers out of the frame. This allowed the puppets to dominate the image and make them more lifelike. This work on puppets and television would lead to separate projects that had different goals.

In 1974, he organized a small cast that was made up of college teachers and students, and then he and Kim Henkel made The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). This film changed the horror film industry. Hooper based it upon the real-life killings of Ed Gein, a cannibalistic killer responsible for the grisly murders of several people in the 1950s. Hooper\'s success with "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" landed him in Hollywood and it remains a horror-film classic. Hooper rejoined the cast of "Texas" and with Kim Henkle again for Eaten Alive (1976), a gory horror film with Mel Ferrer, Carolyn Jones, William Finley, and Marilyn Burns (who played the lead in "Chainsaw").

But despite this and other parts for the likes of Ken Russell (The Music Lovers (1970)) and François Truffaut (the male lead in The Story of Adele H (1975)), he found that acting mostly involved fruitless waiting for the phone to ring interspersed with the occasional TV commercial, while desperately trying to make ends meet. So he began writing screenplays in the mid-1970s, and was lucky enough to secure the patronage of producer David Puttnam who finally produced Robinson\'s script about Cambodia, The Killing Fields (1984) for which he was nominated for an Oscar.
